# Facebook SDK Quick Start

1. Drop the `FacebookSDKInitializer` component on any GameObject in your first scene.
2. Fill your App ID in **Assets/Resources/FacebookSettings.asset** (auto-created by the package).
3. Build & run on device → you should see "Facebook SDK Ready ✓".

That's it — the SDK is now fully initialized and sending accurate install/engagement data to Meta.
